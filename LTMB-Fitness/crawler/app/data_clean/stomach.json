In one motion, pull the handle up and across your body until your arms are in a fully-extended position above your head. Keep your back straight and your arms close to your body as you pivot your back foot and straighten your legs to get a full range of motion. Retract your arms and then your body. Return to the neutral position in a slow and controlled manner. Repeat to failure. Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.  Tip: You will twist your entire body with this exercise, but focus on getting maximal torso rotation and a strong clinch at the end of the movement. To ensure a good mind-muscle connection, keep your abs tense at all times.",

Contract oblique to bring the weight down in a side crunch. Once you reach maximum contraction, slowly release the weight to the starting position. The weight stack should never be unloaded in a resting position. The aim is constant tension during the set. Repeat to failure. Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.  Tip: Keep your arm tucked in tight to your side; donâ€™t move it.

Continue to push down as hard as you can with your lower back as you contract your abdominals and exhale. Your shoulders should come up off the bench only about four inches, and your lower back should remain on the bench. At the top of the movement, contract your abdominals hard and keep the contraction for a second. Tip: Focus on slow, controlled movement - don't cheat yourself by using momentum. After the one second contraction, begin to come down slowly again to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: There are many variations for the crunch. You can perform the exercise with weights, or on top of an exercise ball or on a flat bench.",
