    "instructions": "Attach a weight to a dip belt and secure it around your waist. Grab the pull-up bar with the palms of your hands facing forward. For a medium grip, your hands should be spaced at shoulder width. Both arms should be extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip. You'll want to bring your torso back about 30 degrees while creating a curvature in your lower back and sticking your chest out. This will be your starting position. Now, exhale and pull your torso up until your head is above your hands. Concentrate on squeezing your shoulder blades back and down as you reach the top contracted position. After a brief moment at the top contracted position, inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position with your arms extended and your lats fully stretched."

    "instructions": "Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width. As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position. Pull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar. After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variations:  If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight. Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help. On the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates. The behind the neck variation is not recommended as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck."

Caution: If you are new to this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, using a spotter to hold your legs can help being that it requires putting a lot of stress on the rotator cuffs. Alternatively you can also use a chin assist machine. Variations: If you have developed enough strength to perform this exercise with weights, do so with caution. Side to side chins can be a challenging exercise and if not performed correctly, can cause injury. Before attempting to use weights, make sure you are able to perform the exercise with good form. You can also perform the side to side chins by doing all reps to one side and then the next or by also including the middle movement as well (in which case you would pull up first to the left hand side, then the middle and then the right side). You can use a chin assist machine if you do not have the strength to perform the exercise on your own."

The ball of your feet should be pressed against the floor to help keep you balanced. Place a weighted plate under your chin or behind your neck. This is the starting position. Slowly raise your torso up by bending at the waist and lower back. Remember to exhale during this movement. Hold the contraction on your lower back for a second and lower your torso back down to the starting position while inhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions prescribed in your program.  Caution: If you are new to this exercise, it is best to perform this exercise without any weights until you develop good form.

    "instructions": "This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it. Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. Keeping your legs stationary, move your torso forward by bending at the hips while inhaling. Lower your torso until it is parallel with the floor. Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by elevating your torso back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The stiff-legged barbell good morning is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly."
